# grant-superuser.sh — write the platform:martyrology superuser tuple.
#
# SIBLING NOTE: byte-for-byte the same tool as martyrology-api's
# scripts/grant-superuser.sh — both write to the exact same OpenFGA store and
# object (superuser is a platform-wide grant, not scoped to either app), so
# there is no per-repo variation to carry. Duplicated rather than shared for
# the same reason as setup-stack.sh (see this repo's
# .superpowers/sdd/2026-08-04-local-development-stack/task-13-report.md): no
# submodule/package relationship between the two repos, and coupling this
# repo's bring-up to a sibling checkout would break the GitHub-default path.
# If you change this file, apply the same fix to martyrology-api's copy, and
# vice versa.
#
# Out-of-band by design, exactly as in production. The API's
# /api/v1/admin/permissions endpoint fixes its object type to governance_body,
# so platform: tuples are structurally unreachable through it — otherwise any
# body admin could mint themselves a superuser. Every superuser grant, not just
# the first, is made this way.
#
# The `sub` only exists after that account has signed in once, which is why
# this cannot be folded into setup-stack.sh.
#
# OpenFGA does not validate that a sub corresponds to a real user — a
# transposed digit silently grants superuser to a nonexistent identity while
# the intended person still cannot do anything, with nothing to surface the
# mistake. So this script always prints exactly what it is about to do
# before writing, and asks for confirmation unless --yes/-y is passed.
#
# Usage:   ./scripts/grant-superuser.sh <zitadel-sub> [--revoke] [--yes|-y]
# Revoke:  ./scripts/grant-superuser.sh <zitadel-sub> --revoke
